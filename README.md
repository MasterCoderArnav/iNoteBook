### iNoteBook 
## A simple and secure notebook for your notes

This is a simple notebook that allows you to create, edit and delete notes. It is a secure notebook because it uses a password to encrypt and decrypt the notes. The password is not stored anywhere, so you have to remember it. If you forget it, you will not be able to recover your notes.

Built using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js).
